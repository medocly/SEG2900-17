      <p>Why you ask?</p>
      <p>Because if there is one thing people
      hate more than being sick, it is to have to get up
      of their bed even though they are horribly sick,
      and go see a doctor or buy some medicine. And you
      know what’s the worse part of it? They often did not
      even need to see a doctor.</p>
