        <p>There isn't really good self diagnosis apps out there...
          To be honest, a lot of the solutions offered right now just
          straight up don’t work. But what happens when you really need
          to see a doctor, but you don’t have access to one? Or if you
          only want to do a quick little checkup but don’t want to go
          through the hassle of calling a doctor, getting an appointment
          and then waiting, waiting and waiting again? Or what if you need
          to have some medication, but you’re simply too tired or sick to go
          buy it yourself? We all have a ton of reasons why we would prefer to
          have a more convenient wait to deal with this. Those are the reasons
          why we decided to create Medocly.<br>
          Here at Medocly, we believe that anybody should have access to a good
          and reliable diagnosis. We also believe that anybody should be able to
          get the right medication fast</p>
